### The kite itself
The TU Delft V3 kite with 25 m2 wing surface area is a custom development by kite designer
Martial Camblong, creator of the brand Genetrix, in close collaboration with TU Delft team members John van den Heuvel and Rolf van der Vlugt.

The kite also deforms heavily, although the right photo here is not representative for nominal flight operation but caused by an extreme steering input in combination with an only lightly loaded wing during a launching maneuver from an upside-down hanging position.

### KCU details

![V3_overview](data/images/KCU_CAD.png)

The height (with tape guide), width and length of the KCU without exterior foam padding, as displayed in Fig. 15, is 32.7, 24.4 and 30.5 cm. Because of the space constraints under the shorter cover, the longer cover was quickly used on both sides, which increased the length without foam padding to 39 cm. With exterior foam padding this elongated but symmetric design had a height, width and length of 36, 30 and 53 cm, which takes into account the storage pouch for the progressive-tearing energy absorber.

In the considered time frame from 2010 until 2015, the mass of the KCU increased from initially 5 to 8.4 kg. The mass of the KCU including weak link and entire bridle line system, but excluding wing-mounted sensors and Pitot sensor, is 9 kg. The KCU is connected with
the ground control computer via a fast and a separate slow wireless link. The link quality (latency) was recorded during the test flights. A fixed data rate of 20 Hz in both directions was used. The data from the angular encoders were recorded, as were the motor temperatures and the battery voltage.

### Tether details

The tether is a 16-strand plaited hollow braid rope made of Dyneema® SK75, with a
diameter of 4 mm, a mean breaking load of 13.5 kN, a mean breaking strain of 3.5% and a mass
of 0.91 kg per 100 m.
