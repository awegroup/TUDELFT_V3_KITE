These efforts all come from [Airborne Wind Energy Research Group](https://github.com/awegroup/.github/edit/main/profile/README.md)  at TU Delft.

If you are curious to read more about airborne wind energy in general, we recommend:

- [The lecture notes](https://awecourse.github.io/slides/) from Roland Schmehl's MSc course at the AE Faculty of the TU Delft.
- [Airborne Wind Europe](https://airbornewindeurope.org/) for more general information 
- [The white paper](https://airbornewindeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/BVGA-Getting-Airborne-White-Paper-220929.pdf) written with many prominent people in the industry and BVGAssociates.

These guides were initially developed by the [TU Delft Digital Competence Centre](https://dcc.tudelft.nl). All members of the AWE group are encouraged to modify the guides to:

1. reflect the development practices in the group
2. share solutions and templates
3. support the on- and offboarding of group members

The DCC will not maintain these guides after completion of the DCC support in August 2024, but instead adopt them in the [DCC Guides](https://tu-delft-dcc.github.io/welcome.html).
