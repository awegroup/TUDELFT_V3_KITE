These guides were initially developed by the [TU Delft Digital Competence Centre](https://dcc.tudelft.nl). All members of the AWE group are encouraged to modify the guides to:

1. reflect the development practices in the group
2. share solutions and templates
3. support the on- and offboarding of group members

The DCC will not maintain these guides after completion of the DCC support in August 2024, but instead adopt them in the [DCC Guides](https://tu-delft-dcc.github.io/welcome.html).
